# DDMI (Differential Data Multiple Interface)

## Overview

DDMI (Differential Data Multiple Interface) is a work-in-progress (non-)specification for differential data transfer over an HDMI&reg; connector.

This repo contains the pinout for the [DDMI Pmod&trade; compatible module](https://machdyne.com/product/ddmi-pmod).

This project was inspired by [DVI-PMOD](https://github.com/Wren6991/DVI-PMOD), [SmolDVI](https://github.com/Wren6991/SmolDVI) and the [ULX3S](https://github.com/emard/ulx3s) GPDI connector. 

## Devices

The following is a list of devices with DDMI ports:

  * [Schoko](https://machdyne.com/product/schoko-computer)
  * [Bonbon](https://machdyne.com/product/bonbon-computer)
